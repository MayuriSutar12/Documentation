## Setup of Scalar Box Event Log Fetcher App (Client Credentials Grant with Server Authentication)

### Overview

Operates through the Client Credentials Grant with Server Authentication. Upon authorization, the app generates its user, referred to as the Service Account user, with the username `AutomationUser_2140095_0hbK7pz8HB@boxdevedition.com`.

This app serves a dual purpose:

1. **Events Retrieval:**
   - Fetching user events from Box.
   - Used when a user adds a file or folder to the audit set, where the app adds `AutomationUser_2140095_0hbK7pz8HB@boxdevedition.com` as a collaborator to the respective file or folder.
