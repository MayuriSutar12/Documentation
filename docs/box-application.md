We use two Box applications.

**Scalar Auditor for BOX**: This utilizes User OAuth 2.0 Authentication and integrates seamlessly with our web app. It leverages the BOX API to gather vital information regarding users, files, or folders as needed.

**Scalar Box Event Log Fetcher App**: This application operates on Client Credentials Grant with Server Authentication. 
Its primary function is to create Automated Users, serving as Collaborators for files/folders designated for auditing purposes within our Audit Set. 
Additionally, it efficiently fetches user events for comprehensive monitoring.
