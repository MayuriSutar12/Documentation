### Scalar Auditor for BOX Overview

Scalar Auditor for BOX is a tool designed to facilitate external auditing of cloud storage services, specifically targeting Box.com. It addresses the challenges faced by organizations requiring external audit logs for compliance and security purposes. The application aims to provide the following features:

1. **Log Storage**: Capture and store operation logs from client storage services (e.g., Box, Google Drive) in an external database. This ensures that audit logs are retained for the required duration, even if the retention period of the cloud vendor's logs is insufficient.

2. **Audit Trail**: Record various file operations to enable external auditors to verify the integrity and security of files. This includes tracking:
   - Date and time of file creation
   - Date and time of file updates
   - Date and time of file deletion
   - Location of copied files

3. **Selective Sharing**: Enable users to create a list of folders and files to be audited and share only those specific items with external auditors. This ensures that auditors have access only to the necessary files and folders, maintaining confidentiality and minimizing exposure of sensitive information.

#### Challenges Addressed
- **Lack of External Audit Logs**: Many cloud storage providers, including BOX, do not provide audit logs for external users, which are often required for compliance and regulatory purposes.
- **Inadequate Partial Sharing**: Existing sharing mechanisms may not support partial sharing, meaning that if a folder is shared with an external auditor, they have access to all contents within the folder, including sensitive files. Scalar Auditor for BOX addresses this issue by enabling selective sharing of files and folders.

By providing comprehensive audit trail capabilities and selective sharing features, Scalar Auditor for BOX ensures that organizations can meet their compliance and security requirements while maintaining control over their data shared with external auditors.



### Functional Blocks of Scalar Auditor for BOX

**1. BOX Event Log Fetching and Storing**

This block is responsible for fetching user events from the BOX application and storing them in the database. The events fetched include:

- ITEM_CREATE
- ITEM_UPLOAD
- ITEM_MOVE
- ITEM_COPY
- ITEM_TRASH
- ITEM_UNDELETE_VIA_TRASH
- ITEM_RENAME
- ITEM_MODIFY

In Release 1.0, the event types to be fetched are not configurable. The event data is stored in ScalarDB and ScalarDL.

**2. Querying BOX Events**

This block enables users to query processed information from the stored event log data. The functionalities implemented include:

- Viewing BOX events by selecting a specific date range
- Viewing BOX events done by a specific user
- Viewing BOX events by specific event type

Additionally, this module provides information such as files with the same hash and versions of files, which can be derived from the event logs stored in the database.

**3. User Role Management**

This block manages user roles within the Scalar Auditor for BOX application. There are two types of application users:

- Users with BOX accounts
- External Users, who are external auditors

Roles implemented in Release 1 include:

- Audit Admin: Administrators of the organization, responsible for managing user roles and permissions.
- General User (GEN User): Regular users within the organization.

Upon installation or registration of the Scalar Auditor for BOX application, an Administrator is assigned to the organization, who is considered an Audit Admin by default. Other users are initially saved as GEN Users. However, an Audit Admin user can modify the roles of any user and assign additional roles.

Possible roles for any Organization User include:

- AUDIT_ADMIN
- GEN_USER
- AUDIT_ADMIN + GEN_USER

		Here's a summary of role operations within the Scalar Auditor for BOX application:

| Previous Role           | Operation             | Role after Operation   |
|-------------------------|-----------------------|------------------------|
| AUDIT_ADMIN             | Change (Edit) Role    | GEN_USER               |
| GEN_USER                | Change (Edit) Role    | AUDIT_ADMIN            |
| AUDIT_ADMIN             | Add Role              | AUDIT_ADMIN + GEN_USER |
| GEN_USER                | Add Role              | GEN_USER + AUDIT_ADMIN |
| AUDIT_ADMIN + GEN_USER  | Remove role of AUDIT_ADMIN | GEN_USER           |
| AUDIT_ADMIN + GEN_USER  | Remove role of GEN_USER    | AUDIT_ADMIN        |

## Audit Set Management

An Audit Set is a group of files and folders selected for monitoring purposes. It is assigned a name and description for convenience. The Audit Set management module implements the following functionalities:

- **Create an Audit Set**: Allows the creation of a new Audit Set with a specified name and description.
  
- **Delete an Audit Set**: Enables the deletion of an existing Audit Set.

- **Add Collaborators to an Audit Set**: Collaborators can be added to an Audit Set with varying levels of access:
  - Owner: Full control over the Audit Set, including management and collaboration privileges.
  - Co-Owner: Similar to an owner but with slightly restricted permissions.
  - Member: Users with read and limited edit permissions.
  - Reviewer: Users with read-only access for reviewing purposes.

## Auditor and Audit Group Management

The user management module includes functionalities for managing External Auditors and Audit Groups. External Auditors are users who utilize the web UI of the application rather than the BOX integrations menu. Key functionalities include:

- **Create External Users (External Auditors)**: Allows the creation of users outside the system, who authenticate using their email ID and specified password.
  
- **Delete, Edit, or Update Users**: Provides administrative capabilities to manage user accounts.
  
- **Delete or Edit Groups**: Enables the management of Audit Groups, allowing for the addition or removal of members and adjustment of group settings.

## Audit Data Management and Display

External Auditors require various data for auditing files, including:

- File details.
- Folder details.
- List of file copies (files with the same hash).
- List of file versions.
- Events performed on files in various forms.

This data is processed by the application based on stored event logs or retrieved from the BOX application.

## Validation Functionality

Files or entire Audit Sets can be validated for tampering using the ScalarDL Validation functionality. Validation for an entire Audit Set, containing numerous files and folders, may take a longer time and is suggested for occasional use.

## Managing Addition of Items to Audit Set

Files or folders can be added to an Audit Set for monitoring purposes. This operation is facilitated through the BOX integration menu. Specifically:

- Files are added directly to the Audit Set.
- For folders, the selection of files and subfolders allowed for external auditors is performed at the time of adding to the Audit Set.
